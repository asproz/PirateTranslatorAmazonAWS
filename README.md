# PirateTranslatorAmazonAWS
Test of Amazon AWS

# You can send a POST using the following command:
- curl -X "POST" "https://auvm0nen2k.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/default/TradutorDePiratas" -H 'Accept: application/json' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d $'{"message": "Hello"}'

I'm not sure if Amazon is keeping the service up since it is free and it is just a test
